Bridge23 is radically disrupting data by allowing consumers to sell their data
directly to merchants. We use a traditional "expense tracker" platform to collect
user data and cut out the middle man so that merchants can bid up the price of data, 
based on how much input users give us. And that money goes directly to the users 
themselves, NOT big data companies. The more expenses users track, the more valuable 
their data becomes, the more money they earn from merchants.

Furthermore, by tracking thousands of data points, users also earn customized rewards,
discounts, and special offers from these same merchants, so they can "Get Paid to Save."
Bridge23 is a revolution in the data industry, empowering everyday consumers to earn directly
from THEIR own data, clawing back money and resources from big data companies to help
them manage in a cash-strapped world.

Bridge23 is the future of data, the future of consumer empowerment, and the end of the
big data monopoly that earns off of data that is rightfully ours.
